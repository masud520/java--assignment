# Java Assignment: Concrete Class, Abstract Class, and Interface

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates the use of:
1. **Concrete Class**
2. **Abstract Class**
3. **Interface**

## Explanation

### 1. Interface (`Animal`)
- An interface defines a contract for classes that implement it.
- It contains abstract methods (methods without implementation).
- Example: The `Animal` interface has a method `makeSound()`.

### 2. Abstract Class (`Mammal`)
- An abstract class provides a partial implementation and can have both concrete and abstract methods.
- It cannot be instantiated directly.
- Example: The `Mammal` class implements the `Animal` interface and provides a concrete method `breathe()` and an abstract method `eat()`.

### 3. Concrete Class (`Dog`)
- A concrete class provides a full implementation of all methods.
- It can be instantiated.
- Example: The `Dog` class extends the `Mammal` abstract class and implements the `makeSound()` and `eat()` methods.

## Code Example

java
// Interface: Defines a contract for classes that implement it
interface Animal {
    void makeSound(); // Abstract method (no implementation)
}

// Abstract Class: Provides a partial implementation and can have abstract methods
abstract class Mammal implements Animal {
    // Concrete method: Provides implementation
    public void breathe() {
        System.out.println("This mammal is breathing.");
    }

    // Abstract method: Must be implemented by subclasses
    public abstract void eat();
}

// Concrete Class: Provides full implementation
class Dog extends Mammal {
    // Implementing the abstract method from the Animal interface
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof! Woof!");
    }

    // Implementing the abstract method from the Mammal abstract class
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println("The dog is eating bones.");
    }
}

// Main class to test the implementation
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create an object of the concrete class
        Dog dog = new Dog();

        // Call methods from the interface, abstract class, and concrete class
        dog.makeSound(); // From Animal interface
        dog.breathe();   // From Mammal abstract class
        dog.eat();       // From Dog concrete class
    }
}


## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile and run the `Main.java` file using the following commands:
   bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   

## Output

Woof! Woof!
This mammal is breathing.
The dog is eating bones.
